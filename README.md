# MSDS 603: Machine Learning Ops (Mlops)

Welcome to Yewon Park's **MLOps** repository. This repository contains all the course materials, including labs, assignments, and project documentation.

## üìå Course Overview
This course introduces students to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** concepts, focusing on AI Entrepreneurship, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, and MLOps. Through hands-on labs and projects, students will gain experience in **end-to-end AI/ML workflows**, covering **data management, model deployment, and monitoring**.

### **üìö Course Topics**
- Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**)
- Experiment Tracking & Model Management
- Data Versioning & Quality Assurance
- Container Orchestration
- Cloud-based ML Pipelines
- CI/CD/CT in Machine Learning
- Model Deployment & Monitoring
- Explainability, Privacy, and Fairness in AI
